# Quittance — offline review pack for external AI

Use this document when an AI cannot clone GitHub. Paste this file + the prompt at the bottom into the other chat.

Repo: https://github.com/CemAyyildiz/Quittance  
Stack: Next.js 14 frontend + Express/TS MVP backend + Stellar Horizon (no smart contracts in MVP).

---

## Product lock

- Quittance = invoice → Stellar pay → Horizon verify → download/email proof.
- Not SustainOpen/Stellink payment-link/escrow. Do not propose marketplace/Upwork.
- Identity = Freighter only. Email = optional mailto delivery. No Google gate for create/pay.
- Sharp user: freelancer → client, XLM first / USDC later.
- Demo path: `backend` `npm run start:mvp` / `dev:mvp` (in-memory). Full Postgres `server.ts` now aligned with dynamic `sellerPublicKey` (Phase E1).

## Architecture (MVP)

```
Browser (Next.js + Freighter)
  → POST /api/invoices { amount, sellerPublicKey, optional customerEmail, ... }
  → share /pay/:id + QR
  → Freighter payment with invoice memo
  → POST /api/invoices/:id/verify { txHash }
       → Horizon load tx + payment op
       → check memo, amount, destination (== sellerPublicKey), asset
  → PAID → Download Proof (client PDF) / Email Proof (mailto)
Dashboard: GET /api/invoices?sellerPublicKey=... and stats same filter.
Storage: in-memory Map; restart clears data.
```

## Known gaps / risks (pre-reported; verify and extend)

1. ~~No public URL yet.~~ **Resolved:** deployed to Vercel + Render (see EVIDENCE.md).
2. In-memory = not production persistence.
3. ~~Full `server.ts` + PG still uses env `SELLER_PUBLIC_KEY`~~ **Resolved (Phase E1).**
4. `GoogleLogin.tsx` / `lib/auth.ts` mock may still exist as dead code.
5. `Quittance.jpg` historically contained Stellink branding; landing should not use it as watermark (text brand preferred).
6. USDC needs trustlines — XLM is the reliable demo path.
7. Client PDF is print-to-PDF HTML, not server PDF.
8. No Sentry/analytics/feedback loop yet (Journey Mastery gaps).
9. ~~Redis/Bull deps largely unused.~~ **Resolved (Phase E6):** `redis.ts`, `bull`, `ioredis` removed.
10. ~~Backend `tsc` / Stellar typing noise.~~ **Resolved:** 0 ESLint warnings, 0 tsc errors on both stacks.

## Goals of review

Owner wants blunt senior review for:
- Stellar Startup Track idea alignment (Payments use case)
- Journey Mastery / production-MVP gaps
- Shipping online demo + real users next
- Design quality after landing redesign
- Do NOT recommend Google login gate or marketplace pivot

## Prompt for the reviewing AI

Review Quittance using ONLY the review pack above (and any extra file excerpts I paste). You cannot access GitHub — do not refuse; work from this pack.

Deliver:

1. Executive verdict (5–8 sentences)
2. Architecture review (verify path, wallet scoping, privacy)
3. Product–code alignment vs locked decisions
4. Critical bugs/risks P0/P1/P2 (infer from pack + any pasted code; mark speculation)
5. Production readiness score 1–10
6. UX/design concrete fixes
7. Prioritized next 10 actions for public demo + real users + Mastery (analytics/errors/feedback), without marketplace scope creep

Rules: blunt, English, no fluff, no inventing a different product.
