## Public demo

| Item | Value |
|------|--------|
| Frontend | `https://quittance.vercel.app` |
| API health | `https://quittance-api.onrender.com/api/health` |
| Network | Stellar **TESTNET** |

**How to try (≤ 3 min)**

1. Open the frontend URL  
2. Connect Freighter (Testnet) and fund the account if needed  
3. Create an invoice → copy payment link  
4. Pay with Freighter on `/pay/[id]`  
5. Confirm **PAID** → **Download Proof**  

**Limits:** MVP API is in-memory. Process restarts clear invoices. Keep demos short.

## Tech note (short)

- **Product:** Freelancer invoice → Stellar pay → payment proof (quittance)  
- **Identity:** Freighter wallet only (no Google login gate)  
- **Email:** Optional delivery (`mailto:` for Send invoice / Email proof)  
- **Verify:** `POST /api/invoices/:id/verify` loads the tx from Horizon and checks memo, amount, destination, and asset  
- **Seller model:** Each invoice stores the creator’s `sellerPublicKey` (dynamic wallet)  
- **Storage (demo):** In-memory MVP (`npm run start:mvp`) — not Postgres yet  
- **Proof:** Browser PDF (“Download Proof”) + optional email  

Ship plan: [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md).
